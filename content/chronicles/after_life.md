First off there is more to this world that we realise, we're missing something raw, elemental, maybe it was something we realised in the past but now forgotten or something that we understood at a fundamental level as animals.  My reasoning for this is the energy feelings I get from my hands and from people, it tends to make me think there more, something tells me I've just touched the surface from. 

Secondly, theres one overall god, all other gods are just a different manifestation of it, be it jew, Christian or Muslim its all the same, I don't believe that it matters which one you choose. 

Third, there is more to life after you die, whether that be reincarnation, hell or heaven, or something even more fantastic.  While I've grown up as a catholic I have a hard time in believing in hell, I think its more of idea to allow people that have been wronged to think that at least when they die that the wrongs done to them will be avenged.  But one problem that I have with this is that by doing so, by saying he'll pay in hell are you too not just commiting a 'sin', when most people say that they're realy just wishing that that will happen. Accordingly to the catholic church children that died in infancy before they could be baptised would be placed in limbo (along with other people of other reigions) for eternity, being denied joy but not being placed in hell.  

For me if god would do that to a perfectly innocent child then, he is no god to me if that means that I go to 'hell' then so be it.  I met a catholic evangelist in a healing meeting which I didn't really want to go to, I went for my parents sake.  He talked about how he had seen mary and how she had a beautiful crown and georgeous dress, he went on to say that if you follow the bible you too could be a king in heaven, again it's the carrot and the stick.  Do this and when you die you'll get x.  The problem I have with this scenario is that in his vision he saw mary with crowns etc.  why would she appear with crowns surely she would be beyond trying to impress people with things like that, why not appear in a sack cloth, I think he was placing his own ideas of high stature on her, then the things with becoming as a king in heaven, those were his exact words btw, that conjours images of someone with stature, rank, wealth where you could live the life of a king, wanting for nothing. 

This is where I have my problem, the carrot and the stick, fi I were a god I would think more of an atheist who didn't believe in god or an afterlife, who had lived a good life, trying to do good where he could and as little harm as he could, rather than a god fearing man living his lfe by the bible so that he could become a king in heaven.  This is my belief, if I'm wrong I'm wrong, but isn't that what a belief is. 

And finally I don't follow the ten commandments as I should, I follow my own set of rules, and it isn't a le carte Christianity, its sums most world religions into a few simple rules, well not rules but guidelines.  Its quite simple try not to harm anybody be that in flesh or in feelings, so that rules out murder, infedility, cheating in work/screwing someone over and emotionally harm.  Lets be honest people realise that what they are going to do is wrong, yet they still do it, this is what I think is the worst. The second guidline is the exact opposite, try to do good, whether that be give to charity, falling in love with someone, be kind to people, respect them  or as I may put it in more cruder terms don't be a prick. 

So that's what I live by, and I'm the first to admit I'm not perfect I've broken these rules many a time, but that's not the point, the point is that your trying to do good that you have a belief system that you actually believe in, not one that was drummed into you as a child that you never questioned.  I have questioned it and found my own system that I believe encompasses the core of most religions. 

So if there is a hell, what's the judgement criteria? What happens to you are you placed on stakes and tortured.  To me that seems a little obvious, I would think that reliving the days you did your most harm in the life of the person you harmed, where you experience everything they felt over and over, but the what would be the point of that? Are you just be cruel or are you trying to improve the person so why? where are they going?

So there is no answer that I can give, only one way to find out.

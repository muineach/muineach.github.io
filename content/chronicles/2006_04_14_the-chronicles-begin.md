I've opend a new section called [the Chronicles](/categories/chronicles/), these incude some of my thoughts on religion but mainly they are a chronicle of all dreams that I've been having. I've recorded most of the more interesting ones over the last few years so I'll start to transcribe them when I get time.

[Chronicles section](/categories/chronicles/).

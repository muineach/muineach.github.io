Again I was asleep during the day and this happened. 

I went to sleep as usual, then I wake up somewhere else, there's someone standing over me saying 'xxx can you open your eyes', I try to open my eyes but I can't, I can't move my body at all. Then she starts to rub her knuckles up and down on my chest, like what they do on ER, she says 'can you feel this?' of course I can but I can't move at all, no speech, no movement I can't even open my eyes. Then I wake up, its dreams like this that stick with you for a long time.

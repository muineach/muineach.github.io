2003 

I'm living at home, my mother wants me to go for treatment, and we go into the village into an old building and go up some narrow stairs. We go into the room there are a few beds with patients in them and a few nurses. The bed has some sunlight shining on it as its right beside a window, looking out onto the car park. A young pretty girl is sitting up in the bed smiling; she has shortish back hair with a sight pink/purple blush on her cheeks contrasting how pale she really is. She's very pretty with plumpish cheeks, I say hello and so does she. I ask what the place is like, some simple chit chat, she's nice and we're kinda flirting for a while. 

Meanwhile my mother is talking to the nurse/doctor, then we leave, as we leave I see a man having his sheets changed, with him sitting up in bed. Some time later, I'm being forced into the back of my car, I'm put into the back seat between two other people, my mother s driving and my brother is in the passenger seat.  They are all worried/angry and afraid as we drive into the town, my mother says that I have to go back for more treatment. As we drive down the road, I imagine thousands of beautiful flowers falling gently from the sky onto the road and car.

Next thing then they start to fall and hit the car, everyone else in the car becomes more afraid, they don't know how to react.  We stop before the village, they let me out and told me to go and check myself in, they're frightened. I agree and walk toward the town, but as I get near I cant remember where it is, I was only there the first day so I head toward there. When I get there the stairs are narrower now, barely wide enough for me to fit through, then they disappear, now instead of stairs there are filing cabinets stacked on top of each other filled with patients files.  The cabinets are stacked on top of each other to form a stairway
.
I manage to pull myself up and through the door, there's a sign on the door, it says that there's a group meeting going on. I walk inside and the nurses look at me as if they've seen me before, I see the same scared unsure look in there eyes that I saw in my families faces. I look to the window and see the girl sitting there, smiling, her eyes bright, I walk over and ask here where do I check in, she says its not here, she's still smiling and flirting. 

Then something in her eyes that attracts me, we talk some more and I thank her for helping me, as I leave I turn back to see if she's still looking, she is and says 'and if your good you may even get my number' I smile then turn around and ask 'well what if I'm bad', we both smile, I walk over to a nurse and say that 'I've been here before and I want to check in again'. She says 'yes I know you, I've been briefed about your case' with a very stern look. 'You need to go across the road to check in', so I leave and as I walk toward the place to check in I begin to think the only reason that I'm being out in here is that my family wont talk to me, I'm not the problem, they are the ones with the issues. Then I walk by the 'treatment' place, I though of the girl in the bed and whether I should go back or not, but I wasn't sure.

I turned around and then saw a sign outside the building with the girl in it, the building was due to be demolished.

I'm on a beach, looks like the ones of the lost television series. I'm on the beach and I think there are other people there maybe 10 or more, for some reason we all decide to rush into the sea, for what reason I don't know. As the water gets up to my chest I look down and I can see a wire, its like a tripwire, so me being me I pull it. Next minute al the people go rushing out of the water and up the beach fleeing in all directions. 

There's a small boy with me, I thinks he's lost so I hold his hand and try to get him to safety, what are we running from? well there's a huge tyrannosaurus-rex on the beach, but he's not the normal size he's much bigger, more like Godzilla. So I rush up the beach I get onto a rocky outcrop with the child, the t-rex is just behind us, we try to hide behind a rock, the t-rex comes up and tries to bite us, first from the left, then the right. Then he says 'ah your not worth it' and walks off.

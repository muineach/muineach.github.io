Well the simplest way to put it is "I went down" but not in a good way.  On the 4th of April I was having my breakfast when akk of a sudden my tongue went into spasm, I gargled and then I blacked out.

I opened my eyes to see the paramedics standing over me, next thing I remeber is coming too in the ambulance, then waking up in the Accident and Emergency Room. It took me about 2-3 hours to fully come to, they did all of the usual tests on my blood etc. then I got sent for a CAT scan, which the results seem to say that the tumor has "shifted", not sure how but it has. 

So now I'm sitting at home for a full week while I wait to go and see my Neurosurgeon, so everything is up in the air again, I'll just have to wait and see.

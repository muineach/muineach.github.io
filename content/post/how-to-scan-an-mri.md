So when I managed to get my MRI scans, I thought that if I could scan them I could send them to friends, and heh I was bored. After doing some searches on google and on newsgroups there were some suggestions, scan it with a mirror on top of the MRI (didnt work) and some other suggestions. So I found a way that works well, its quite technical: 

- Scan the MRI with the top of the scanner open (do it in a bright room)

Thats all I had to do, apart from stitching the images together.

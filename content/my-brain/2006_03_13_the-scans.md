Ok so here are my MRI scans of my head, this are just the small thumbnails of the images, the main images are much larger at about 1.5 meg at the resolution of 2700x3000px. If you're looking to see the tumor well on one side of the brain theres a darker spot covering nearly one side of the brain, that's just bruising, the actual tumor is a much darker spot that should be easy enough to see.

To view the full size image just click on the thumbnail.

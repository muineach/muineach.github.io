_Derek remains sadly missed by his friends, family and colleagues to this day.  [Derek's obituary is here](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/derek-davis-obituary?id=40320424), and re-produced below in case it disappears from the internet_:

"_Davis, Derek Lagore Road, Dunshaughlin, Co. Meath died on 10th October, 2009._   

_Derek's parents John and Teresa, brothers John and Paul, sisters Louise and Suzanne and extended families would like to thank most sincerely all our relatives, friends and neighbours who sympathised and supported us on our sad loss. Our thanks to each one who visited the house attended the funeral services and travelled long distances to be with us._

_Thank you for all the Mass cards, certificates, letters, phone calls, gifts and floral tributes. Thanks to Donnie and Carol Clynch for their beautiful singing and music in the church. The family would also like to thank Dr. Tierney, Dunshaughlin for his care._ 

_Our sincere gratitude to all Derek's work colleagues in Hewlett Packard for their friendship and support during his illness. A special thank you to Fr. Joe Clavin, P. P. who became a very dear friend to Derek._ 

_As it would be impossible to thank everyone individually, we hope you will accept this acknowledgement as a token of our sincere appreciation. The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass has been offered for all your intentions._"

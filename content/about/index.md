## Who am I?
Well I'm a 27 year old guy living in Ireland who's been recently diagnosed with a brain tumor.  To read my story, click [here](/post/the-story/).

### Remembering Derek
_This website is the resurrected Blog of Derek Davis, a young man who passed away tragically on Saturday, 10th October 2009 from a brain tumor - he was 29 years old at the time.  The original blog site was written in a technology which is no longer supported so this version has the original content but the layout is different (and not as nice!).  This revised version of the blog contains a little extra material and was created in 2024.  In general, any text not from the original blog is italicised to make it clear that they are not the words of Derek._

### Derek's Obituary
_Derek remains sadly missed by his friends, family and colleagues to this day.  [Derek's obituary is here](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/legacyremembers/derek-davis-obituary?id=40320424), and re-produced below in case it disappears from the internet_:

"_Davis, Derek Lagore Road, Dunshaughlin, Co. Meath died on 10th October, 2009._   

_Derek's parents John and Teresa, brothers John and Paul, sisters Louise and Suzanne and extended families would like to thank most sincerely all our relatives, friends and neighbours who sympathised and supported us on our sad loss. Our thanks to each one who visited the house attended the funeral services and travelled long distances to be with us._

_Thank you for all the Mass cards, certificates, letters, phone calls, gifts and floral tributes. Thanks to Donnie and Carol Clynch for their beautiful singing and music in the church. The family would also like to thank Dr. Tierney, Dunshaughlin for his care._ 

_Our sincere gratitude to all Derek's work colleagues in Hewlett Packard for their friendship and support during his illness. A special thank you to Fr. Joe Clavin, P. P. who became a very dear friend to Derek._ 

_As it would be impossible to thank everyone individually, we hope you will accept this acknowledgement as a token of our sincere appreciation. The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass has been offered for all your intentions._"

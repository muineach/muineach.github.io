## Who am I?
Well I'm a 27 year old guy living in Ireland who's been recently diagnosed with a brain tumor.  To read my story, click [here](/post/the-story/).

### Remembering Derek
_This website is the resurrected Blog of Derek Davis, a young man who passed away tragically on Saturday, 10th October 2009 from a brain tumor - he was 29 years old at the time.  The original blog site was written in a technology which is no longer supported so this version has the original content but the layout is different (and not as nice!).  This revised version of the blog contains a little extra material and was created in 2024.  In general, any text not from the original blog is italicised to make it clear that they are not the words of Derek. To read some stories from colleagues that knew Derek, check out [remembering Derek](/gallery/derek_book) in the Gallery._

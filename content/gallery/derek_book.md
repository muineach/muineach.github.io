_Derek passed away on Saturday 10th October 2009 in the company of his loving family.  A month later, his family visited HP-Leixlip where there was a ceremony as a tree was planted in his memory.  Some memories of Derek from his colleagues were gathered into a book and overlaid on top of the great man's photos and presented to his family.  These are below._
